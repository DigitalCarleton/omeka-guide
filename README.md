So you've decided to use Omeka&mdash;great! Here is a set of documentation to help you get started. In the spirit of sharing information and expertise across campus, this guide is designed to be a remixable resource: fork it and customize it for your own class or research project.

This documentation draws considerably on Iris Jastram's ["How to Use Omeka" guides](http://blogs.carleton.edu/dh/2016/03/02/how-to-use-omeka-handouts/).
