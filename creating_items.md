# Creating Items

##Digital Materials
Items are the fundamental building block for Omeka. For all other items use the steps here:


* Click “Items” on the left side of the admin interface
* Click the green “Add An Item” button.

Now it's time to describe your item by adding metadata. We'll work through all 4 available options from left to right.

2. Item Type Metadata: Select the appropriate item type from the dropdown menu and fill in the relevant fields according to your Project's Metadata Guide.
3. Files: Click "browse" and upload the digital file(s) for your item. Omeka allows you to associate multiple files with a single item. 
4. Tags: Select appropriate tags according to your Project's Metadata Guide.

In the box on the right-hand side of the Files page, select an appropriate Collection for your item. Each item can be added to only one collection.

Note: If there are no collections listed in the dropdown box, you can create one in the “Collections” section if appropriate.

Finally, click “Add Item” and you’re done!
