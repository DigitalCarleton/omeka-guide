# What is Omeka?

Omeka (pronounced oh-MEH-kah) is a tool that lets researchers create digital libraries of items, organize those items in various ways, and then create “Exhibits” from those items. Exhibits lead viewers through your collections of items, putting items next to each other in useful ways and adding text and interaction so that visitors to your website can understand some aspect of your collection more fully. Think of Omeka as a museum. At any given time, only a portion of the things the museum owns will be on display, and the displays will have explanatory text and some theme to them so that visitors can walk into a gallery and gain something not only from the individual items on display but also from the arrangement of the items selected for display. Your job is to become a curator at this online museum about your topic, collecting items, cataloging them for your inventory, and then selecting and arranging items for display.

## Which version do you need?

There are two main versions: [Omeka.net](http://www.omeka.net/) (which is hosted and updated by the Omeka team) and [Omeka Classic](http://omeka.org/) (self-installed version).

## Suggested workflow

We suggest that projects start in Omeka.net to best figure out if Omeka really is the right platform for the project. Everything you do in Omeka.net can be migrated easily to Omeka.org should you decide you want to expand your scope so there's no harm in starting in the stable hosted version. For help figuring out which version is best for your project, please email or call Celeste Sharpe ([csharpe@carleton.edu](mailto:csharpe@carleton.edu), x5245).
