# What is Omeka?

Omeka (pronounced oh-MEH-kah) is a tool that lets researchers create digital libraries of items, organize those items in various ways, and then create “Exhibits” from those items. Exhibits lead viewers through your collections of items, putting items next to each other in useful ways and adding text and interaction so that visitors to your website can understand some aspect of your collection more fully. Think of Omeka as a museum. At any given time, only a portion of the things the museum owns will be on display, and the displays will have explanatory text and some theme to them so that visitors can walk into a gallery and gain something not only from the individual items on display but also from the arrangement of the items selected for display. Your job is to become a curator at this online museum about your topic, collecting items, cataloging them for your inventory, and then selecting and arranging items for display.
Creating an Omeka Account
Your professor will invite you to an Omeka site. Before that happens, set up your Omeka account:
Go to Omeka.net
Click “Sign Up”
Select the option to “Try the free Basic plan” near the bottom of the page.
Fill in the sign-up form, using your Carleton email address whenever possible. (Tell your professor if you need to use another email address for some reason.)
Logging into your Omeka Site
When your professor sends out the invitations, you’ll get an email from Omeka with a link to accept the invitation. (If you don’t see this email, check your Spam folder.) Once you have accepted the invitation, log in to this site: [Insert link to admin interface for the site]

Throughout the site, nothing is saved until you click “Save Changes.” 
Creating Items
As you find items that belong in your inventory, you’ll upload and describe them. For streaming audiovisual material (like YouTube videos), see this Embed Items guide. For all other items use the steps here:
Click into the “Items” section of the admin interface
Click the green “Add An Item” button.
The first section to fill out is the Dublin Core page.
            This is where you add information that describes your item according
            to this metadata guide.
           


The next section to fill out is the Item Type Metadata section. 
Select an appropriate item type from the dropdown box and then fill out as many of the resulting fields as you can.


Finally, you’ll upload files for your item. 
Browse for the files you wish to upload.
In the box on the right-hand side of the Files page, select an appropriate Collection for your item. Each item can be added to only one collection.
Note: If there are no collections listed in the dropdown box, you can create them in the “Collections” section
Finally, click “Add Item” and you’re done!

Note: You will not be able to make the item public. Your professor will do that once she has approved your item and description.
Adding & Managing Tags
You may tag items however you think is useful as you go. Part way through the project, you’ll want to look over your tags and start thinking about normalizing them and defining them so that you can use them consistently. At that point you’ll probably go back in and edit earlier item tags to make everything consistent.

In the Items section of the Omeka admin interface, find the item
            you wish to tag in the list of all items and click “edit” under its title.
Click into the “Tags” section of the item information 
           
Add tags separated by commas (so: parody, female creator, political)
Click “Add Tags”
Click “Save Changes” on the right-hand side of the page when you are done tagging.

You can also manage tags by clicking into the “Tags” section of the admin interface. You’ll be able to see all of your tags, view all the items associated with each tag, edit the tag, or delete the tag from this area.
Using Collections
Each item can be assigned to only one collection, so you want to think carefully about your items and how they can be sorted before creating a new Collection. If items could fall into more than one collection, than the collection names are probably better used as tags.

To create a new collection, click “Add a Collection” and then give the collection a Title and Description and any other metadata that makes sense for your project.





To add items to a collection, you have two options:
Open an individual item and select the collection from the dropdown menu on the right-hand side. Then click “Save Changes.”
From the “Items” page, check the boxes next to all the items that will be moved into this collection. Click the “Edit” button near the top or bottom of the item list, and then select the collection name from the Collection dropdown menu.

Creating Exhibits
You can create multiple exhibits, and each exhibit can have multiple pages. Your goal here is to put items from your growing repository together in ways that helps a viewer know them, or see something useful in their proximity. Play around with combinations of items and with different page layouts to see what will best accomplish your goals.
Adding an Exhibit
In the “Exhibits” section of the admin interface, click the green “Add an Exhibit” button. Then fill out a title and description for your exhibit. Also select whether you would like viewers to start on a “summary page” (which will link to all the exhibit pages and give you space to describe the exhibit or set the scene) or if you’d like viewers to start right at the first page of your exhibit.

You will also have to choose a “slug” which is the wording at the end of the URL. This should be a set of letters and/or numbers. You can use upper-case and lower-case letters, but no spaces or special characters other than a dash or an underline. You should choose ONE of the following methods of putting together multiple words into a slug and then use this method consistently throughout the site:
PoliticalSatire
political-satire
political_satire

Click the green “Save Changes” button on the right-hand side of the page.
Adding an Exhibit Page
At the bottom of the exhibit description and configuration page, click the green “Add Page” button. 
Give your page a title and a slug using the naming convention your class chose above.
The rest of the page will be made up of one or more “Content blocks.” Select the block layout you want and then click the green “Add new content block” button.
Within each content block, add items and text to design the page. (If you wish to embed streaming video, use this guide.)
When you are happy with the page, click the green “Save Changes” or “Save and Add Another Page” button on the right-hand side of the page.
